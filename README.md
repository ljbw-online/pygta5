Building on the work done by Sentdex to teach an artificial neural network to drive around in Grand Theft Auto V.

I would like the agent to play in the way a human does, i.e. by just looking at the game window and deciding which key to press. I'd like to get to the point where it can do taxi missions for long periods of time without supervision.
